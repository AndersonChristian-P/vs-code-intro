Just make little strokes like that. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. Don\'t hurry. Take your time and enjoy. In your world you can create anything you desire. That\'s the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. You can spend all day playing with mountains. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. Do an almighty painting with us. We\'ll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy.
