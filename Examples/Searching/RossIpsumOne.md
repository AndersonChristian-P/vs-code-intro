This is the way you take out your flustrations. Mix your color marbly don\'t mix it dead. This is truly an almighty mountain. Let\'s make a happy little mountain now. It\'s beautiful - and we haven\'t even done anything to it yet. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. Isn\'t it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Clouds are free they come and go as they please. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. Isn\'t it great to do something you can\'t fail at?
